    { term: 'ISP', cat: 'network', def: 'Internet Service Provider. Can see all unencrypted traffic, DNS queries (without DoH/DoT), and connection metadata. Required by law in many countries to store browsing records for 1-2 years.' },
    // J
    { term: 'JWT', cat: 'protocol', def: 'JSON Web Token. A compact, URL-safe token format for transmitting claims between parties. Consists of Header.Payload.Signature encoded in base64url. Must be validated carefully — algorithm confusion attacks are common.' },

Types include viruses (self-replicating), ransomware (encrypts data for ransom), spyware (monitors activity), rootkits (hides existence), and trojans (disguised as legitimate software).' },
    { term: 'Man-in-the-Middle (MITM)', cat: 'attack', def: 'An attack where the attacker secretly relays and potentially alters communication between two parties who believe they are communicating directly. HTTPS, certificate pinning, and HSTS all help prevent MITM attacks.' },
    { term: 'MFA / 2FA', cat: 'protocol', def: 'Multi-Factor / Two-Factor Authentication. Adds an extra verification step beyond a password. TOTP apps (Authenticator) are better than SMS (vulnerable to SIM swapping). Hardware keys (YubiKey) are the most secure form.' },
    { term: 'Metadata', cat: 'privacy', def: 'Data about data. File metadata can include author, creation date, GPS location, and editing history. Network metadata includes who communicates with whom and when — often more revealing than content.' },
    // N
    { term: 'NDA', cat: 'legal', def: 'Non-Disclosure Agreement. A legal contract that restricts sharing of confidential information. Security researchers often encounter NDAs when doing coordinated vulnerability disclosure.' },
    // O
